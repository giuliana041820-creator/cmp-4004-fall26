"""Week 6 studio — the Logic-LM arm-B plumbing (GIVEN; use it, do not rewrite).

The instructor provides the plumbing so you can spend the 25 minutes on the
*prompt* and the *refinement loop*, not on parsing. This module has:

  * ``MODEL_PROMPT``      — the exact translation prompt from the lesson plan.
  * ``parse_json(text)``  — pull the first JSON object out of an LLM reply.
  * ``build_csp(spec)``   — turn the parsed JSON spec into a CSP that the SAME
                            ``backtrack_search`` from ``csp.py`` can solve. It
                            supports the three constraint types the prompt asks
                            for: ``alldiff``, ``neq``, ``eq``.
  * ``classify_arm_b(...)`` — the four-way failure taxonomy from the plan.
  * ``EXAMPLE_PUZZLES``   — the three worked NL-puzzle → JSON-spec pairs kept inline
                            as few-shot fuel (also the first three in the bank).
  * ``load_puzzles()``    — the full bank of 20 verified puzzles from ``puzzles.json``.
  * ``worked_examples()`` — the 5 fully-worked starters (``worked_example: true``).

What you write (in ``starter.py``): the prompt wiring around your local model and
the self-refinement loop. See README §"Task 2".

Note on data: the plan's bank of *20* natural-language logic puzzles now ships as
``puzzles.json`` next to this file — each entry has the NL statement, the CSP spec
in the schema below, and the UNIQUE gold answer, all verified sound by
``_verify_puzzles.py``. Five are marked ``worked_example`` (the three inline
``EXAMPLE_PUZZLES`` plus two more); the rest are for the students to run. Load them
with ``load_puzzles()`` and report how many you ran on the scorecard.
